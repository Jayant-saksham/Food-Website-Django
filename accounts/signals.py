"""
    As soon as User is created, we wish to create a UserProfile. This can be done using signals.
    Signals are used to perform any action on modification of a model instance. 
    The signals are utilities that help us to connect events with actions.
    There are 3 types of signal.

    -   pre_save/post_save: This signal  works before/after the method save().
    -   pre_delete/post_delete: This signal  works before after delete a modelâ€™s instance (method delete()) this signal is thrown.
    -   pre_init/post_init: This signal is thrown before/after instantiating a model (__init__() method).


    For using signals in Django, we need to go to other resources as Django docs and github 
    does not provide information in simple language.
    I suggest you to use GFG or StackOverflow for basics.
